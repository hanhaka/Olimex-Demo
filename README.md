Olimex-Demo
===========

Demo project using A13-OLinuXino-WIFI - Open Source Hardware Board with LCD Touch Screen

Goals of this demo project are:
- Get familiar with the Olimex board and the LCD touch screen
- Use Linux Debian OS (delivered with Olimex Micro SD card) as an Operating System
- Connect some kind of sensor(s) to board's input pin(s) and read the measurement data.
- Implement a simple backend web server on the top of Node.js platform. Backend logis handles the reading of measurement data and serving it to clients connected to server.
- Implement a simple but (hopefully) a snazzy UI using HTML5/JavaScript/CSS + suitable open source web stack. Plus add support for touch screen user experience for Olimex LCD display.
